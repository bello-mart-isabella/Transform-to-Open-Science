# Module 5: Open Results
# Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, learners will have an in-depth understanding of how open science principles help with increasing the reproducibility and replicability of research, as well as guidelines by which to choose the best location to publish their research. Learners will have hands-on experience with creating a replicable, open science workflow and using a virtual research environment, and practice with some tools that make such a workflow possible.  

# Module Outline
* Why open results?
     - Amplifying the impact of your research
     - How sharing results and getting credit is changing
     - Equity and open access.
* Sharing results
     - Preprints
     - Executable notebooks
     - Blogs, social media, video tutorials…
* Open Science as advocacy (e.g., your own rights as an author, advocating for open access for others) 
* The reproducibility crisis and how we can combat it with open science
* What is Open Access? What are the benefits of Open Access? How does it help or hinder general open science principles?
     - Guidelines on how to choose the right open access journal/site
* Replicability deep-dive; what does it mean to document research such that it is replicable? 
     - Data repository and data-sharing standards and their impact on replicability 


Suggested Exercise: What is your favorite open access journal? What are the pros and cons of that platform? Create a full, research workflow that incorporates multiple principles of open science.
