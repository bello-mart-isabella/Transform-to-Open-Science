# Module 3: Open Software 

# Learning Objectives
At the end of this module, learners will understand the impact of open-source code, and have hands-on practice with choosing a license, creating a README, and uploading code to GitHub/GitLab. Learners will understand the importance of high-quality and documented code. Learners will discuss the impact of open-source software on open science and advancing equity in scientific fields. 

# Module Outline 
* Why share software? 
     - Sharing software as a form of improving impact, reproducibility and and replicability of research
     - “If the code is good enough to publish a paper, then it is good enough to share” 
* Common fears about sharing software
* How you share matters:
     - Software repositories
     - Software licenses 
     - Software DOIs
     - Documentation
* How to attribute/cite open software 
* Executable notebooks
