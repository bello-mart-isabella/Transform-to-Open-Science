# Module 4: Open Data
# Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, learners should feel comfortable creating a data management plan that follows FAIR principles, including assigning a license/copyright, metadata tagging, and assigning PIDs. Learners should also feel comfortable utilizing and assigning metadata. 

# Module Outline 
* Why share data? 
* Common fears about sharing data
* How you share matters:
     - Restrictions
     - Data repositories
     - Data licenses 
     - Data DOIs
     - Documentation, metadata, FAIR
* How to attribute/cite data 

Suggested Exercise: Have an open discussion on the argument for databases as “publications” or rewarding the accumulation of high-quality data as noteworthy accomplishments
