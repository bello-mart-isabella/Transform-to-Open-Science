 
# Module 2: Open Science Tools & Resources 
# Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, a learner will have gained hands-on experience working with different open science tools, databases/datasets, and policies. Learners should have been introduced to open science communities within their field of study. 
 
# Module Outline
 
* Why use open tools?
* Introduction to Open Science communities
* Introduction to online places where one can ask questions, build community: StackOverFlow, GitHub discussions, Twitter, Discord
* Introduction to popular tools and resources for Open Science, which may include but not be limited to…
    - [Jupyter Lab](http://jupyter.org/)
    - Version control (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) 
    - Best practice for creating research/study plans
    - Preregistering important study aspects (*e.g.*, [AsPredicted](https://aspredicted.org/), [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/), and [Registered Reports](https://cos.io/rr/))
    - Shared notebooks (e.g., [mybinder](http://mybinder.org/), [Rocker](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.03675) or [Code Ocean](https://codeocean.com/)

Suggested Exercise: Module should include hands-on experience with some of the tools mentioned above
