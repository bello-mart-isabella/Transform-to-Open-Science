## Creating Community: Our Ground Game
<img align="right" src="../../assets/github/Communities_CynthiaHall.png" style="width:175px;height:194px;">
Open Science is built on community. Central to its success is diversity, inclusivity, accessibility and equity. NASA’s Transform to Open Science (TOPS) efforts can’t be successful without working with diverse communities. When we learn from each other, we all come out stronger. 






With 2023 on the horizon and the Year of Open Science quickly approaching, our efforts revolve around two primary areas of focus: [inreach to existing](./inreach.md) communities of practice and [outreach](./outreach.md) to communities of potential. 


Critical to these relationships is open, candid, and complete two-way communication.  In the spirit of openness and transparency, the TOPS team will hold a series of community engagement forums. 

## Community Forum/ Listening Sessions
These sessions will educate the public about NASA’s OSSI and the TOPS program and create conversation where people can engage with us, give feedback on initiatives, and discuss opportunities and challenges. These sessions will feature an open-source science advocate/practitioner or discuss a topic of interest, followed by a listening session where participants have an opportunity to shape the conversation. The ultimate goal of the sessions is to have the community transition into long-term partnerships with increased community involvement.

### Come join us! 

Exciting announcement, for the month of July, we will be shifting our previously scheduled Community Forum to a special topic on Monday July 25 . In August we will resume our normal Thursday time. 

When: July 25, 2022, 10AM EDT (UTC -4)

## Community Panel
The TOPS Community Panel is another way we create community and discover best practices for engagement. This event brings together leaders from the open science, open source software, and data science communities with the NASA TOPS team for a detailed review of TOPS plans and vibrant discussion.  Panelists review and provide input on NASA’s strategy for transitioning to open-source science. Feedback helps us shape engagement and community building practices for the Year of Open Science in 2023. Every April NASA will announce an opportunity to be a panelist. Community Panels are public and we have created  tools for the public to submit questions. Our May Community Panel is a virtual meeting and open to all. It is free to attend.

When: May 17-19, 2022, 12:00-3:00 PM EST each day
