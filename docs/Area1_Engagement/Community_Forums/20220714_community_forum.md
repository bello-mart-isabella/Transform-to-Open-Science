# TOPS Community Forum - July 2022

Exciting announcement, for the month of July, we will be shifting our previously scheduled Community Forum to a special topic on Monday July 25. In August we will resume our normal Thursday time. We invite the Open Science community to contribute feedback to the TOPS OpenCore Curriculum as a content reviewer. We will provide an overview of the module objectives and lesson topics developed by the Module Leads and Content Subject Matter Experts during the recent June 27 - July 1 curriculum sprint. Then, the TOPS Team will walk through the process of providing feedback.

**Date:** July 25, 2022, 10AM EDT (UTC -4)
