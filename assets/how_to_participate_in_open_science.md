# A short guide on how to start participating in open science communities

## Open science communities
- [Pangeo](https://pangeo.io/) - an open science community with a weekly community meeting that starts with a 15 min science talk. Meeting schedule is at the bottom of [this](https://pangeo.io/meeting-notes.html) page.
- [Openscapes](https://www.openscapes.org/) - an open source community offering mentorship, teaching, coaching and community organizing centered around open data science
           
## Open software 
- [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) - a great fun way to first get involved in open source software at any level.
- Pick your favorite open source library, go to it's GitHub page, and click on 'issues'. You can search for `is:open label:"Good first issue"`. An example for [matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/labels/Good%20first%20issue)                  

## Social media
- [Medium](https://medium.com/) - People post a lot of tutorials, news about new developments in data management, cloud, it is a great space to learn.
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/home) - Follow scientists/data/organizations and get a daily feed of all the latest developments in open science (eg. [OpenSci_News](https://twitter.com/OpenSci_News) #openscience #openaccess #opendata
               
## Open discussions
- [Pangeo Discourse](https://discourse.pangeo.io/)
